# 🎥 YouTube-Style Video Manager (Hackathon Project)

A simple CLI-based YouTube-style video manager built using **core Python**, developed as a solo project during the **Skill IT Academy Hackathon** (August 2, 2025). The goal was to implement CRUD operations **without internet access**, using plain text files for data storage.
