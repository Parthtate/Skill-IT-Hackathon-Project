#  YouTube-Style Video Manager (Hackathon Project)

A simple CLI-based YouTube-style video manager built using **core Python**, developed as a solo project during the **Skill IT Academy Hackathon** (August 2, 2025). The goal was to implement CRUD operations **without internet access**, using plain text files for data storage.

---

##  Features

-  **Create** new video entries (title & duration)
-  **Read** / list all stored videos
-  **Update** video details
-  **Delete** a video
-  Data stored in a local file using JSON format (`youtube.txt`)
-  Built with a single script for simplicity and clarity

---

##  Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python 
- **Storage:** Local file system (JSON in `youtube.txt`)
- **No external libraries**, **no database**, **no internet used**

---

##  Demo

```bash
$ python social_media_platform.py
